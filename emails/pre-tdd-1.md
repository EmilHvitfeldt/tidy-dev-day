Hi everyone,

Tidyverse Developer Day is coming up soon -- Thursday, August 15!

To help us plan projects for the Tidyverse Developer Day, could you please fill out the following (extremely short!) survey: https://forms.gle/6n5vD1zwZQpu2mQk7.

We'll meet at the Fred Hutch Cancer Center, starting at 9am. We will send more detail instructions for getting closer to date. We recommend you come a little earlier (>=8:30am). We will provide coffee, lunch and heavy snacks throughout the day but you might want to get breakfast before you arrive. We'll wrap up the day with a social hour at 4pm.

To get ready for the day, please follow the steps under "Get ready" at https://github.com/tidyverse/tidy-dev-day?tab=readme-ov-file#0-get-ready. Other helpful resources are as follows:

- Good source for getting the basic set up done: https://happygitwithr.com/
- Example of small PR: https://usethis.r-lib.org/articles/pr-functions.html
- Preparing a system for package dev: https://r-pkgs.org/setup.html

If you haven't made a pull request (PR) before, please also practice this once by following the instructions at ___. (TO DO: Add after merging.)

Additionally, we will be holding two (optional) hour-long virtual "office hours" for Tidyverse Developer Day participants prior to event to help you with your Git workflow so that you can stroll into TDD confident that your R, RStudio, Git, and GitHub are set up in the most ideal way possible to work in harmony on your laptop. We will also answer any questions you might have about the event. We anticipate that the office hour would be most helpful for those who are new to package development and collaboration on GitHub, but all are welcome to attend regardless of prior experience. 

The office hours will be for one hour, starting at the following times:

- Mon, July 29 - 12:00 PST / 15:00 EST / 19:00 GMT
- Wed, July 31 - 07:00 PST / 10:00 EST / 14:00 GMT

You can join at https://positpbc.zoom.us/j/93415867745 anytime during the hour.

Looking forward to seeing you all soon!
